> With Backbone, you represent your data as Models, which can be created, validated, destroyed, and saved to the server. 

> The single most important thing that Backbone can help you with is keeping your business logic separate from your user interface. When the two are entangled, change is hard; when logic doesn't depend on UI, your interface becomes easier to work with.

> Backbone.js has hard dependency on underscore.js and a soft dependency on jQuery. Itâ€™s made up of the following modules:
- Views
- Events
- Models
- Collections
- Routers
